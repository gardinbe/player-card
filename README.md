# player-card
A simple player card, which shows information about a selected player.
This is not using react, lit or any of the alternatives. Its not clever, and components have to be fully re-rendered if the value of props change...

Uses fancy stuff like:
- sass sprite (team logo)
- typescript stuff
- custom component based rendering
