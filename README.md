# player-card
A simple football player card, which shows information about a selected player.

This is not using react, lit or any of the alternatives. It uses a basic custom 'component' solution which is not clever: components have to be fully re-rendered if the value of props change...

Uses fancy stuff like:
- Sass sprite (team logo)
- Typescript stuff
- Basic custom component rendering logic
